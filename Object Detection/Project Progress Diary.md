# Object Detection Project Progress Diary

Welcome! This portion of the project is my progress diary which will be updating until the finished product. The aim of this is to show the steps taken to create such a project, the research and time put into it. 

In this project I will be showcasing my app that I created for object detection for android. 

The aim of this project it to achieve an application that will use your phones camera and detect several objects in live time, I have also thought about adding a feature that will allow the user to import their own images/videos and have the app detect objects in them too. 

I will be updating this file like a project diary as I work through this. 

* Project started - 17/7/20
  - Looking into YOLO(You Only Look Once) which is a type of object detection CNN and other models
  - Tensorflow Lite read up
  - Creating a calendar to do list for this project
* Research - 18/7/20
  - Running inference with Tensorflow Lite, allowing my model to work in Android Studio 
  - How to convert my ML model into model.tflite 
* Preliminary object detection on android - 19/7/20
  - I first used the pre trained model available on the Tensorflow Lite website on my Android phone, this allowed me to see the backend in Android Studio.
  - I also built that TensorFlow Lite object detection app into an apk so it is saved as an application on my phone. 
* 20/7/20
  - Installed the Tensorflow Object Detection API, this will be used when I have trained my own model and converted it into a .tflite format 
   - Looked at the commercial applications for object detection and the requirements 
  - Decided to use try MobileNet first and then will work with YOLO. 
  
On a side note I have also decided to do 2/3 small projects, so I will be alternating the days between these projects.
