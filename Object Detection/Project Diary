# Object Detection Project Diary
In this project I will be showcasing my app that I created for object detection for android. 

The aim of this project it to achieve an application that will use your phones camera and detect several objects in live time, I have also thought about adding a feature that will allow the user to import their own images/videos and have the app detect objects in them too. 

I will be updating this README like a project diary as I work on this.
