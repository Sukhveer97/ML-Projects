## General Info 
For this project you will be able to use images and videos for object detection and tracking, I use the pre-trained YOLOv4 and the COCO dataset and the Darknet framework for this. YOLOv4 is much faster and accurate than its previous versions. You will be able to upload your own images/videos to this code, I am currently working on building this into a ML application/web-based product for commercial usability. 

## Technologies 
* Python 3.6 on Google Colab connected to Python 3 Google Compute Engine Backend (GPU)
* CUDA (10.1)

The screenshot below shows how to have GPU (and OPENCV) enabled, and to verify CUDA

## Data
You can get the Darknet framework from GitHub, the original framework is in C, an api is used to make it into Python.
