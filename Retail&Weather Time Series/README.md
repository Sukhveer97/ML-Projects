In this project the aim is to see using historical data to predict the trends in two seperate datasets, one for a weather dataset and the other on retail. 

## Technologies 
Visual Studio Code connected to a Jupyter Notebook Server using Python 3.8.2 

## Model and Algorithms 
* Autocorrelation 
* Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test
* Prophet 
* Moving Average 
* Exponential Smoothing
* ARIMA 

## Data 
Weather dataset is from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/muthuj7/weather-dataset)

Retail dataset is also from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/manjeetsingh/retaildataset)
